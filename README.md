# ownCloud Demo 

*Note*: This demo is not yet in a working state. Some bugs with headless
setup of the database, filesystem and initial admin user need to be
resolved. If you'd like to take a crack at it yourself, this may help:

This repo may be replaced with a proper fork of ownCloud's git
repo in the near future.

http://gitorious.org/owncloud

At the moment, it's a copy of the 3.0.2 stable release.
